## Commercial / Non Commercial Use
Free for all use starting 11th Novemember 2024



## Uses
1. If you keep the topology same you can use a program like wrap 3D to use the same rig over and over again with a different shape of geometry.
2. In case you have sculpted the mesh in Zbrush you can use this to fit your skeleton to fit the new shape.
3. In case you wanna scale your current model in the scene.

## Instructions on how to use.
1. Run from script editor or save to shelf. You can save the py script anywhere, it's not path dependant.
2. Click on the corresponding buttons after having selected the objects in the scene, the currently rigged object is Original Mesh, the scaled or modified model is New Mesh, and the root joint is the primary joint of the skeleton.
3. Once the skeleton is in position, use either the UV method or the Dictionary method to reskin the modified mesh.

## Note
1. Written in Python 3. Will not work in older Maya version.
2. Works on hierarchal joint based skeleton system.
3. Will ignore if something like a mesh, or helper is part of the hierarchal chain.
